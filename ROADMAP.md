# kori Roadmap

This file tracks UI-only work. Core SDK changes live in `../nacelle/ROADMAP.md`. Both repos release with the same tag (e.g. `v0.8.0` / `tui/v0.8.0`) in a two-commit flow: core first, then UI pinned to it.

---

## Track D — Legibility (UI only)

1. **Tool-call line summarizer & aggregation** — `view.go` `absorb` replaces raw-input `say` with name + primary argument (`command`, `path`, `pattern`, `query`), truncates via `truncate`, and aggregates consecutive calls. *Done: kind-based grouping in `toolgroup.go`, batch duration and deduplication across failures in v0.21.6/v0.21.7.*
2. **Silent successes** — successful tool result prints nothing; duration folds into call line. Failures keep loud line; repeated identical failures collapse to one line with count. *Done via `failureCollapse`.*
3. **Refuse malformed tool-call JSON** — duplicate keys at trust boundary surface as refused call with reason, not decoder-last-wins. *Done via `strictObject` in `toolline.go`.*
4. **Collapsed thinking** — `thinking.go`: `KindThinking` renders one dim line while running, then `· thought for Ns (ctrl+t to read)`; ctrl+t toggles viewport over `m.run.reasoning`. *Done.*

---

## Track E — Claude-Code-grade Organisation (builds on D)

5. **Batching by kind** — consecutive same-kind calls render as one updating line (`⏺ 4 commands · mycelium sync · ls docs · …`), flushed on kind change or `settle`. Clamped within pane width to avoid live region wrapping. *Done in `toolgroup.go`.*
6. **Status footer** — elapsed timer, input/output/cached tokens, ctx, trimmed, and cumulative cost on status line. *Done via `statusrender.go` footer and `/status` command.*
7. **Turn boundaries** — spacing plus running totals at `KindTurn`. *Done via `turn.go` / `view.go` in v0.21.7.*
8. **Recap before quit** — tools run, tokens, cost, two lines printed after `Run` returns beside exit-transcript dump. *Done via `recap.go`.*

## Track H — Sessions, Then Compaction

- **Log rotation & write-failure warning** — rotate session files at 256 KB, gzip old file (`.gz`), start new timestamped file. *Done via `sessionrotate.go`.*
- **Session summary command** — *Done via `/status` command.*
- **Dynamic compaction window** — automatically scales the trigger when unconfigured. *Done: the ratio ladder in `docs/plan-compaction-robust.md`. Phase 0 shipped the config surface and `ResolveBudget`; Phase 1 landed the zone/ledger model in `internal/compaction` (`Plan`/`Apply`/`Tombstone`) and the tiered trigger — soft tombstones history with no model call, mid and hard folded it into one `[state ledger]` under a pinned anchor. Phase 2 added the opt-in TypeSafe System One judge (`internal/jev`, batched keep/prune/ledger, hard force-summarizes what it keeps). Phase 3 surfaced it: the footer shows the live ratio and tier (`↕120k/200k · 0.60 · soft`) and `/status` reports the ledger and the last pass's tier, with ratios, tiers, judge and privacy written up in `docs/configuration.md`, `README.md` and `example.kori.yml`. Phase 4 hardened it: re-running the whole validation matrix closed a hole in I1 where the ledger could absorb a kept tool call and orphan its result — `internal/compaction` now extends the ledger zone over its own replies and carries an absorbed block forward (`Apply`, `Plan`, `ledgerCarry`). 2026-09-22 followed a review against published practice: the verbatim tail is sized by `keep_tokens` with `keep_turns` as its floor, the ladder is read against the window less a `reserve_tokens` runway with `window_tokens` to override a backend that reports none, and the pre-send guard fires at the trigger itself — the footer's denominator is that usable window (`↕120k/160k · 0.75 · soft`).*
- **Summarize near the limit** — the gap nacelle's own Track H item 17 left open: past the mechanical drop of old tool results, an assistant-text-heavy history had no fallback before the window ran out. *Done here, consumer-side as that item requires: smart summarizes the history into the ledger once the ratio is crossed, keep the deterministic tombstone as the failure path, and let `/status` name the tier that ran (`internal/compaction`, `internal/tui/compact*.go`).*
- **Resume** — `--continue` picks the newest session under `~/.kori/sessions/<project>/`; `/resume` picker in the TUI to resume past conversation. *Done via `--continue` flag and `/resume` command.*
- **Subagents overview** — show list of running subagents and current task progress one per line under the input prompt (like pi or antigravity). *Done via `parallel_result.go` in v0.26.0.*

---

## Track I — Background scheduling (cron)

A cron for agents: unattended, no daemon. Jobs live inline in `~/.kori.yml` under `cron:`; the `kori cron` subcommand fronts the existing headless path. The scheduler is systemd/Cron — kori only surfaces and arms it.

- **`kori cron list`** — show jobs and their armed state. *Done.*
- **`kori cron run <name>`** — run one job headless, deliver the transcript. Defaults are reversed for unattended runs: shell (`commands`) off and `enabled` off, because a run nobody can answer must not reach a live approval prompt. `install` refuses a disabled job so test-run-first is explicit. *Done (Phase 1).*
- **`kori cron install <name>`** — directly install the job into user's crontab with tagged markers, log redirection, and automatic PATH/key resolution. *Done.*
- **`kori cron uninstall <name>`** — remove an installed job from crontab. *Done.*
- **Delivery** — `delivery: "file:<dir>"` appends a status header + transcript to `<dir>/<name>.log`; unset means journal/stdout only. *Done (Phase 1).*
- **Phase 2 (not yet built): promotion UX** — repeat a chat job, agent offers to schedule it, test-runs it once into the same thread, creates it enabled-by-design, and auto-disables on failure with a notification. Mirrors the `syntheses/background-agent-scheduling.md` reference.
- **Not doing** — a daemon, a job DB, retry, or parsing systemd/crontab syntax inside kori.

---

## Track J — Diagnostics loop

The model should see what its edits broke without being told to check: filet findings land in the session right after an edit, and a pull tool re-checks on demand.

- **Post-edit diagnostics loop** — run `filet check` on every file a tool just wrote, injecting the findings into the session through an AfterToolCall hook (built-in, `internal/diagnostics`, kill switch `tools.diagnostics`), plus a `diagnostics` pull tool the model can call between edits. Design source: `syntheses/coding-agents-lsp-integration.md`. *Done via `internal/diagnostics` and `withDiagnosticsHook` in `internal/agent`.*

## Release process

1. Core lands changes, tags `vX.Y.Z`.
2. UI bumps `go.mod` to require that core version, applies UI changes, tags `tui/vX.Y.Z`.
3. Both CI pipelines must pass (`go test ./... -race`, `golangci-lint`, `goreleaser`).
