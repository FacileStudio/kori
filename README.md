# kori

Terminal coding agent — the human harness for the
[nacelle](https://github.com/FacileStudio/nacelle) agent SDK.

The binary is named `kori`. The SDK is a Go library for building agents;
this program is its first consumer and lives to exercise every part of it from
a terminal, where someone is watching: text, reasoning, tools starting and
finishing, why a turn ended, what it cost. It is deliberately small — sessions,
profiles and panes are what a product grows, not what a contract test needs.

**Note**: This repo changed its name from `nacelle-tui` to `kori` on 2026-09-14. The core SDK (`nacelle`) remains the same library.

## What it does

- Streams one model turn at a time in a full-screen Bubble Tea v2 interface
- Runs against any backend the SDK ships: `anthropic`, `google`, `openai`, or `openrouter`
- Lets the model read and edit files under a root you choose, run commands when
  `-bash` is on, fetch web pages, and call MCP server tools from files
  every other client already has (`-mcp ~/.claude/.mcp.json`)
- Lets the model lay a large job out as steps and keep them current while it
  works, drawn live above the prompt and scrolled to the step in flight
- Fans independent side tasks out to concurrent nested runs with `-subagents`,
  so a wide search or a log dump costs the conversation one answer instead of
  its whole output
- Discovers project context (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md) and skills into the system
  prompt, each behind its own flag
- Gates tool calls behind an approval prompt with `-approve-tools`, and trusts
  project hook files only after an explicit, remembered decision

```

Installs to `~/.local/bin` via [facile](https://github.com/FacileStudio/facile), the suite
installer. Pass `--bin-dir <dir>` to change that, `--source` to build from source.

Already have `facile`:

```sh
facile install kori
```

Or Homebrew:

```sh
brew install FacileStudio/tap/kori
```

## Usage

Run it in the directory you want it to work in:

```sh
kori
```

It reads API keys from the environment: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for the default
backend, `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) for `-backend google`,
`OPENAI_API_KEY` for `-backend openai`, and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for `-backend openrouter`.

Settings layer bottom-up: defaults, then `~/.kori.yml`, then `KORI_*`
environment variables, then flags. The useful ones:

| Flag | Env | What |
|---|---|---|
| `-backend` | `KORI_BACKEND` | `anthropic`, `google`, `openai`, or `openrouter` |
| `-model` | `KORI_MODEL` | model id; the backend's own default otherwise |
| `-root` | `KORI_ROOT` | directory the file tools may reach |
| `-bash` | `KORI_BASH` | let the model run commands (off by default) |
| `-continue` | — | auto-resume the newest session for the current project |
| `-resume` | — | resume a specific session by id or file path |
| `-no-config` | — | start with default settings, ignoring ~/.kori.yml |
| `-tasks` | `KORI_TASKS` | task planning tool (on by default) |
| `-approve-tools` | `KORI_APPROVE_TOOLS` | ask before every tool call runs |
| `-subagents` | `KORI_SUBAGENTS` | give the model the parallel delegate tool (on by default) |
| `-max-iterations` | `KORI_MAX_ITERATIONS` | how many times the model may be asked |
| `-mcp` | — | MCP servers file (repeatable) |
| `-skill-dir` | `KORI_SKILL_DIRS` | extra skills directory (repeatable) |

`kori -version` prints exactly `kori <semver>`. See `-h` for the full set:
reasoning effort and budget, web fetch, project-context and skill
discovery, hooks trust.

## Configuration

Settings live in `~/.kori.yml`, **written on first boot with every default
explicitly set** — delete it to regenerate. An existing file is never touched.
The example file with all defaults, and the full reference with the
precedence order and the traps in each setting:
[docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

`example.kori.yml` in this repo is the same file the first boot writes — the whole
surface, abridged here. The abridgement is illustrative: the scaffold-parity test covers
`example.kori.yml`, and nothing reads the block below, so a wrong key here fails no gate —
it fails at load, under `KnownFields`, when you paste it.

## Context compaction

A long session is measured against the backend's context window and compacted at
the ratio it has crossed, instead of at one absolute token count. Two tiers, the
second a superset of the first:

| Tier | Crossed at | What it does | Model calls |
|---|---|---|---|
| soft | `soft_ratio` (0.65) × usable window | Tombstones oversized old tool results — deterministic, no model call | 0 |
| smart | `smart_ratio` (0.80) × usable window | Classifies each history block and folds it into one `[state ledger]` message, keeping, pruning or folding; forces the fold when the gentle one would not land | 1 judge + 1 ledger |

Whether a pass *forces* — folding the whole history rather than the blocks the
judge left in place — is not a third threshold. It is derived: the pass forces
when the gentle fold it just built would not leave the conversation under its
trigger. Asking that question directly is more precise than a second ratio, which
had to serve every window size at once, and it is safe because forcing only ever
moves a block from kept to folded: a prune still needs the judge's probability and
confidence, so forcing costs verbatim fidelity and never a fact.

The *usable window* is the backend's context window less `reserve_tokens` — the
runway the model needs to finish its own answer — so the top rung still leaves the
reserve plus a fifth of the usable window, instead of a fifth of the raw one.
That reserve is an engineering hypothesis rather than a measurement: it defaults
to a fifth of the window between 8k and 64k, and a session that knows what its
model needs should set `reserve_tokens`. A backend that reports no window at all
can be given one with `window_tokens`.

The verbatim tail is sized by `keep_tokens` (40k by default), a budget rather
than a count of messages, so two heavy reads can no longer pin the window open.
`keep_turns` is the floor underneath it — how few messages the tail may ever
shrink to, one by default, the live turn alone — and the first
`anchor_messages` messages, the original task, are never rewritten, summarized or
pruned, so the goal cannot be compacted away. The ledger is rebuilt, and it is
rebuilt by *merging*: a later pass folds new facts into the existing one line by
line, so a summarizer that restates what the ledger already holds adds nothing to
it. Never a summary of a summary — the ledger is only ever shown to a call that
also carries turns no earlier pass compressed. Once the body outgrows one summary
(2000 tokens, the same ceiling the summarizer writes under) the next pass
*consolidates* it: one rewritten block instead of an addition, accepted only if
it still names every identifier the old body named, otherwise the merge stands.
`limits.compact_at` still speaks last (an absolute ceiling when set, `0` disables
compaction), and a backend that reports no context window falls back to it.

If a provider refuses a request for length anyway — the ladder is measured
against an estimate, so it can — kori compacts once and sends the turn again.
That retry forces the fold, it happens at most once per turn, and it is
skipped entirely when `compact_at` is `0`.

The judge is **opt-in and off by default**: turning on
`limits.compaction.judge` sends conversation history — which can include source
code and secrets — to TypeSafe's System One model for classification, so it is
the one setting here that leaves the machine. Its key prefers the
`TYPESAFE_API_KEY` environment variable over `limits.compaction.judge.api_key`.
With the judge off, compaction behaves exactly as it did before the ladder
existed. The status line shows the live load and tier against the usable window
(`↕120k/160k · 0.75 · soft`), and `/status` reports the ledger and the last
pass's tier.

## Sandboxes & remote hosts

kori runs on the host and sends every tool call to the target over SSH, so the
provider keys and the local filesystem never enter the environment the model
reaches. Two commands cover the two kinds of target:

```sh
# Local boite microVMs
kori sandbox list              # configured sandbox.targets and running boite VMs
kori sandbox pingu             # interactive session inside a VM
kori sandbox pingu --snapshot  # snapshot the overlay disk when the session ends

# SSH hosts
kori remote list               # hosts configured under remote.targets
kori remote staging            # interactive session on a configured host
kori remote deploy@build:2222 "run the tests"
```

`sandbox` targets resolve to local [boite](https://github.com/FacileStudio/boite)
microVMs: an entry in `sandbox.targets`, then a registered instance of that
name. `remote` targets resolve to a `remote.targets` entry, a direct
`user@host:port` address, or an `~/.ssh/config` host alias. Each reads its
defaults — user, port, identity, workspace — from its own group in `~/.kori.yml`.

Scheduled jobs are not configured here anymore: one YAML file per job under
`~/.kori/jobs/`, trusted with `kori cron trust <name>` before it runs.
Use `kori cron list` to view all jobs along with their enabled and crontab installation status.

## herdr

Run inside [herdr](https://herdr.dev), `kori` reports its live state and
session identity over herdr's socket API (`internal/herdr/`). A kori pane
shows as an agent with an idle / working / blocked state, and herdr holds a
reference to the run's transcript. This needs no herdr binary update and works
on any machine, including stock herdr.

After a herdr **server restart**, herdr restores a kori pane as a plain
shell in its saved directory — kori is not in herdr's compiled-in resume
table, and no config or plugin adds it. Reopen the session in that directory
with `kori` (auto-resumes the newest session by cwd) or
`kori --resume <transcript-path>`. Real auto-restore awaits herdr adding
kori to its resume table; `--resume` already accepts the exact absolute
transcript path the reporter reports.
