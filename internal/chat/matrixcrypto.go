// change in their own client, while a missing session is what a broken device
// looks like. Saying which one happened is the whole point.

// selfSign makes the bot's device a signed part of the account's cross-signing

//
// It matters because the alternative is a human tapping emoji in Element on a
// device that only exists to answer messages, and interactive verification is
// the one thing a headless bot cannot do.
//
// Three cases, and the third is the one that needs a human:
//
//   - no identity yet: generate one, sign this device, and hand back the
//     recovery key, which is the only way to restore those keys onto a fresh
//     database since they otherwise live in the account's server-side SSSS.
//     A homeserver does not demand user-interactive auth to publish a first
//     master key, which is why this works unattended.
//   - an identity, with this device already signed by it: nothing to do.
//   - an identity kori cannot sign with, which is what logging Element into the
//     bot's account first produces. Nothing here can fix that: replacing the
//     identity needs user-interactive auth, and a homeserver that has moved to
//     OAuth offers no password stage at all (matrix.org offers only m.oauth and
//     a browser URL). The remedy is the operator's, so the error says so.
