// A fifth is a hypothesis rather than a measurement, and the honest way to read

// ResolveBudget turns the compact_at setting and the compaction ratios into the
// ceiling a session actually runs on. A value someone set — file, environment
// or flag — wins outright, and 0 in it still turns compaction off. An unset
// value derives the ceiling from soft_ratio × the window a turn can fill, and
// falls back to settings.DefaultCompactAt when the backend reports no window at
// all. The ratio ladder is carried whether or not compact_at overrode the
// ceiling, so a session that pins compact_at still tiers its passes.
//
// The reserve is subtracted before the ladder is read rather than from each rung
// in turn: a ratio names a fraction of the window a session can actually fill, so
// hard_ratio 0.90 leaves a tenth of the *usable* window plus the whole reserve
// for the response, instead of a tenth of the raw one.
//
// A derived ceiling that comes out zero or less falls back to
// settings.DefaultCompactAt rather than staying at zero, because a ceiling of
// zero is how every gate spells "compaction off": letting a degenerate ratio
// produce one would turn the ladder off while reporting it as enabled. Settings
// rejects such a ratio at load, so this is the floor under a caller that built a
// Compaction itself.
