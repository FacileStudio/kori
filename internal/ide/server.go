// Package ide publishes a running session to an editor over a unix socket,
// and carries the editor's answers back.
//
// Nothing here exists unless the session asked for it: with the surface off
// there is no socket, no discovery file and no goroutine, so a session nobody
// watches behaves exactly as it did before the feature existed. The publisher
// is an ordinary nacelle hook registered at the points a tool call is visible
// at, which is what keeps a second client of the session off the agent's own
// code path.
