// state renders the goal and the blocks into the text every question is asked
// against. The goal is the pinned task, so a block is judged by whether the
// original task still needs it rather than by how recent it looks.
//
// The block text is untrusted — it is tool output and file contents, and a block
// can argue for its own verdict. That is why the only destructive decision is
// gated twice in decide (the prune probability and the calibrated confidence),
// and why anything unclear falls back to Keep. Widening what is sent here, or
// what one verdict is allowed to do, means revisiting that gate rather than this
// function.
//
// Every piece of text that reaches the request is cut here or before it: each
// block arrives already cut to maxBlockText and the batch to defaultMaxState, and
// the goal is cut below — it is the anchor's own text, so a session whose first
// message is a pasted file would otherwise put more into the request than every
// block combined, which is the byte cap's whole purpose. One more block's worth is
// the ceiling, because that is what the goal is: one block of text, and the one
// the pinned task lives in.

// questions is one choice question per block, all answered in one call. Adding
// more questions does not cost a second round trip for JEV.
//
// Each question names its own block. Every question is evaluated against the same
// state and in isolation, so a question that does not say which block it is about
// leaves the model answering about "it" — and because the batch is otherwise
// identical it answers the same way for every block, which reads as a confident
// unanimous verdict on seventeen different turns. The block key is the only link
// between a question and its block, so the instruction has to carry it.

// choiceQuestion spells the three options out as the criteria. The value of JEV
// is that it decides rather than writes, so the criteria are the whole contract
// with it — and they have to be disjoint, because an option that overlaps another
// leaves the model no confident answer to give. "A dead end worth keeping" and "a
// dead end with no lasting value" is one such overlap: the same block satisfies
// both, the distribution flattens, and the calibrated confidence drops under the
// floor so no verdict is ever acted on. Each description below names the shape of
// block that belongs to it and nothing else.
//
// A choice's criteria is an object keyed by option and not a list of sentences.
// The endpoint validates the shape and answers 422 to a list, which is the one
// failure a stub server cannot catch — see
// TestChoiceQuestionCriteriaEncodeAsAnObject.
