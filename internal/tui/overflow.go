// armRecovery notes a context-length rejection for settle to answer, and reports
// whether it did. It is called from the middle of a run, when the only honest
// options are to fail loudly or to end quietly and let settle try to rescue the
// turn — and ending quietly is why this exists rather than recovery living in
// consume: the run's channel has to close and its state be tidied before a pass
// can start, because the pass snapshots the conversation the run was reading.
//
// It refuses four ways, and each refusal is a case where the failure the reader
// is about to see is the truthful one. A different error is not this failure; a
// turn that already spent its retry has been answered once and a second pass
// would only repeat it; with no agent there is no summarizer to pass the context
// to; and with compaction switched off the reader has asked the client not to
// manage the window for them, so the rejection stands as the provider's own
// answer.

// recoverOverflow answers a rejection settle found waiting: it says what it is
// about to do, and hands the turn to a retry. Nothing to compact is one case it
// cannot fix — a conversation with no history zone is a single oversized turn,
// and no pass may touch the anchor or the live window — so the provider's own
// words are said there and the recovery stops.
//
// A turn the reader stopped is the other, and the check has to live here rather
// than in afterRun. An abandoned run is not owed an answer: esc said the turn was
// called off, and retrying it would spend a pass and a run on a question nobody
// is waiting for, against a context the reader has already moved past. maybeGrind
// reads the same signal for the same reason. The rejection above is consumed
// whether or not the retry happens, so a later run cannot find it still armed and
// answer the abandoned turn after all — which is exactly what skipping the call
// from afterRun would leave behind.

// and it only does that for a session that is still running.
//
// The pass is forced rather than chosen. A size the ladder would have caught
// cannot be what just failed: the provider refused the request as sent, whatever
