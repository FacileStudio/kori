// compactBeforeSend is the pre-flight half of the trigger: when the context the

// the turn would land past the ceiling, compact first and hold the send until
// the pass settles. It is the guard that turns the threshold into prevention —
// without it a single heavy turn is absorbed rather than avoided.
//
// It must not depend on the backend being able to count tokens. Counting is the
// accurate measure when it is offered, because it sees the conversation exactly
// as it will be sent, but the OpenAI-compatible runner reports token counting as
// Unsupported — and a guard that only runs when counting succeeds is a guard
// that silently does nothing on that backend. Counting is therefore the
// preferred measure, not the required one: when it is unavailable the last size
// the provider reported in a usage event stands in. That is the same source the
// post-turn trigger reads, so the two automatic paths agree on what the
// conversation costs instead of one of them going quiet.

// to measure against and so must not fire on a guess — and a count of zero is

// a run that needs the freed context, and this compacts after a turn that grew
// too big — beginning no run, because the pass reports through
// settleCompaction, which starts nothing while the model is idle.
//
// It only fires when nothing is queued, so it cannot race a run about to
// start: deliver hands any queued line to send, whose own pre-flight check sees

// LLM call, so it must not race a live run — the command only fires while
