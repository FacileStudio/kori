// Package tui — how a compaction pass presents itself while it runs, and what it
// tells the reader when there was nothing to install: the spinner must keep
// ticking, and the running-row elapsed timer with it, even on the idle and
// /compact paths where run.busy stays false; and a pass that got no usable
// summary must say so rather than leave only a weak mask card.
