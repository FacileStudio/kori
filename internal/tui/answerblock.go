// short, each row padded onto the block backdrop (or left on the terminal's
// own background when transparent blocks are on), and the whole thing wrapped
// by the same left-bordered box the tool panes draw, with a blue spine. It is
// shared by the committed block and the streaming region, so the spine is on
// the pane from the first streamed delta, not only once the answer finishes.
