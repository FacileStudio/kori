// Nothing is kept. This client used to hold every line in a viewport and

// terminal from then on: its scrollback, its selection, its search, tmux's
// copy-mode. See View for why that is worth more than owning them.

// say has callers that cannot return one — absorb folding an event, flush
// committing an answer. Update drains the queue after every message, so the
// order lines are said in is the order they land in.
//
// Spacing is not each line's business: paint arms and renderers emit whatever
// edge newlines they happen to emit, so say trims them all off and prints
// joins the queue with exactly one blank row between lines. Uniform spacing,
// whatever said it.
//

// replays the conversation rather than the display. fromStart is the one
// speaker that paints but is not recorded — the start message is client
// chrome, not part of the conversation.

// of order is not a transcript. Joining them first makes the whole batch one
// message, which insertAbove writes in one go.
//
// One message, but not necessarily one Println — see printed, which cuts a
// batch taller than the window has room for into pieces that still arrive in
// order. Joining here and splitting there is deliberate: the split is a
// property of the screen, and nothing about what was said should have to know

// Nobody is labelled. A transcript prefixing every line with who said it
// spends the left margin on something the styling already says, and reads
// like a chat log rather than like a session. The reader's own question is
// the thing they scroll back to find, so that is what gets a muted background
// plus the same left half-block spine (▌) the tool boxes and the prompt draw,
// reading as a bordered pane; the answer is the thing being read, so it gets
// none, and is rendered as the markdown the model almost certainly wrote it

// What the client says about itself is the one thing not held to a width,
// and the banner is why. It is painted in newModel before any WindowSizeMsg
// has arrived, so the only width available is the 80 the model starts at —
// and it is now printed to stdout before the program starts, so it is never
// repainted either. Unconstrained, the terminal wraps it the way it wraps
// everything else, which is what this file argues for everywhere else.
//
// Width is taken once, here, at the moment the line is printed. It can never
// be re-taken: the line is in the terminal's scrollback from then on, and a
// resize reflows it the way the terminal reflows everything else rather than
// the way this client would. That is the one thing owning a viewport bought
// that this gives up, and it is worth it — every other tool in the terminal
// behaves this way, including the shell the client was launched from.
