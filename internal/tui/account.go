// account holds what the client knows about what the session has spent: the
// usage total, and what it knows about how much context the conversation is
// carrying.

// The two live together because they answer one question from two sides — what
// the session cost, and whether the conversation is now too heavy to continue
// as-is — and both outlive any single run.

	// rate is the realised cost per token of the most recent turn that
	// reported one: its Cost divided by its total billed tokens. The status
	// line multiplies the live output-token estimate by it while a turn
	// streams, so the dollar figure ticks without waiting for the turn to
	// end. It stays zero until a turn reports a Cost — and stays that way on
	// backends that never report one, so no dollars are invented — and the
	// authoritative per-turn Cost replaces the estimate at the next turn
	// boundary.
	rate float64

	// size is the input cost of the most recent finished turn, in tokens.
	// Every turn re-bills the whole conversation as input, so this is also
	// what the conversation would cost to send again right now — measured,
	// by the backend's own accounting, not guessed from bytes.

	// trimmed is how many history tool results have been masked. It reaches the
	// status line, because a model whose memory was quietly edited should not be
	// the only one who knows.

	// compactBegan is when the current compaction pass started, stamped in

// It is only ever called with a turn's own usage. KindDone carries the run's
// total — the sum of every turn's input, the conversation billed once per turn
// — which is a bill, not a conversation, and reading it as a size would show a
// three-turn run as three times the context it actually holds.
//
// A usage that reports no input at all is left as it stands rather than written
// through. Zero input is what a backend that does not report usage on every
// event looks like, and taking it at face value would erase the one measure both
// automatic triggers read — compaction would stand down silently, which is the
// same failure the pre-send guard had when it treated an uncountable backend as
// nothing to do. A conversation of any size never bills zero input tokens, so
// the guard cannot hide a real reading: it only refuses to remember a number
// that means "unknown" as if it meant "empty".
