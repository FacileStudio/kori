// Tests for the ask a pass puts in front of the summarizer, and for the one
// property the design calls the ledger's protection: a call that may rewrite the
// ledger is never handed the ledger alone. I3b in docs/plan-compaction-robust.md
// is the reason a rewrite is legitimate at all — it is measured against turns no
// earlier pass compressed, rather than being a summary of a summary — so what is
// asserted here is checked against the call runCompaction actually makes, not
// against the builder in isolation.
