// contextLoad is the status surface's name for the conversation's size against
// the window it is measured on: `↕120k/160k · 0.75` once the backend reports a
// window, a plain `↕120k` when it does not, with the tier appended once the size
// has crossed one. One shape, so the footer and /status cannot disagree about
// how full the context is.
//
// The denominator is the window a turn can actually fill — the backend's window
// less the reserve held back for the answer — because that is the figure the
// ladder is read against. Showing the raw window instead would print a ratio
// below mid_ratio while the session was already compacting at mid, which is
// exactly the kind of disagreement the tier suffix exists to prevent; the raw
// window and the reserve are named on their own line in /status.

// and appends the tier the size has reached, so a session whose compact_at sits
// under the soft ratio prints a share below 0.65 under a `soft` suffix, and
// nothing on screen said which number put the tier there. Naming it against the
// same denominator as the footer is what makes the two reconcilable — 50.0k of
// 160k usable is 0.31, so the footer's 0.38 is over it.
//
// The ratio is left off when there is no window to measure it against, the way
// contextLoad leaves off its own: a windowless backend has no usable figure for
// either line to be a share of.

// compactionLines is what /status adds about the ladder beyond the footer's own
// figure: the size against the window with the tier it has reached, the compact_at
// the tier is read against, the window itself with the reserve the ladder holds
// back from it, the accumulated ledger with the tier of the last pass that wrote
// it, and the judge when it is on. A session with nothing to say — no size
// measured, no window, no ledger yet, no judge — adds no lines, and the trigger
// is the one exception: it is a setting like the judge rather than a measurement,
// so a session that has compacted nothing yet still names where it would start.
//
// The judge gets a line of its own because it is the one setting that sends the
// conversation off the machine, and it is otherwise invisible once enabled: a
// reader who opted in months ago has nothing to remind them that every pass
// ships the history somewhere. It sits with the ladder because it is part of it —
// the judge is what decides which turns the fold is allowed to take.
//
// A second line names the model version that actually answered and what it billed,
// once one has. The setting defaults to the vendor's drifting `jev-latest` alias,
// and the thresholds are tuned against a specific version behind it, so the id has
// to be readable before it can be pinned.
