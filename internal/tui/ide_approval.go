// ideApprovalTimeout is how long an attached editor has to answer a pending

// gone quiet — and what it ends with is a refusal.

// on a socket, so it runs in a command of its own rather than in the update
// loop, and the loop learns the answer as a message like any other. A session
// whose surface is off pays the nil check and nothing else: the terminal prompt
// it already has is the whole of its approval surface.
//
// A surface with no editor attached answers Unanswered, immediately, and the
// parked call is left to the terminal. That is the difference between opening a
