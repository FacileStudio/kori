// validateTail rejects a tail bound or a window figure that cannot work. It runs
// on the resolved settings, so only a value a layer actually wrote down is
// judged — a job file that mentions one ratio and nothing else keeps the shipped
// tail rather than failing on the fields it never named.
//
// Each rejected value is a number a zero would quietly disable rather than a
// preference. `keep_tokens: 0` leaves the tail sized by keep_turns alone,
// `window_tokens: 0` reads as "ask the backend" — which is what leaving it out
// already means — and a reserve that leaves under half of a declared window
// usable shrinks the ladder to a single rung: usable collapses toward one token,
// every tier trips at once, and the session sits at hard while the config still
// reads as enabled. That is the same failure `soft_ratio: 0` used to have, and
// failing at load is what keeps it from being found out later.
//
// The reserve and window are only compared with each other when both were
// written down here. The window usually comes from the backend, which this layer
// cannot see, so ResolveBudget cuts a reserve that would swallow it instead.
//
// The message floor is judged the same way, against the same cap the token budget
// is held to. A `keep_turns` whose own turns already weigh more than half of what
// a pass may fill keeps the tail over that cap whatever the budget is: the floor
// is laid down before the budget widens anything, and the active window is never
// rewritten, summarized or pruned by any tier, so the pass the tail triggers
// could never land under its own trigger. What the floor costs is a count of
// turns nobody has taken yet, so it is judged on the package's own estimate of
// one — see refuseFloorOverCap.

// that heavy is what the cap exists to prevent, and no pass can move it — the
// active window is never rewritten, summarized or pruned — so a config promising
// one is refused rather than left to sit in the thrash guard.
//
// Only what a layer wrote down here bounds the cap, the same way the reserve is
// judged. Either figure bounds the cap on its own: the usable window can never
// exceed the window_tokens override, and the ceiling can never exceed the
// compact_at this layer is handed, so whichever of the two a session wrote down
// is what the floor is measured against. With neither written the window is the
// backend's own and this layer judges nothing, because a check that refused a
// config over a window it cannot see would be a worse bug than the floor.
//
// One message is estimated at compaction.EstMsgTokens: a floor is a count of
// turns the session has not taken, so there is nothing to measure, and the
// package's bound for one unit of history is what stands in for one. It is the
// right proxy for an unwritten turn because a turn is what a block is — a tool
// call with the reply answering it, or a standalone turn — and the tool result in
// it is exactly the weight that bound exists for.
