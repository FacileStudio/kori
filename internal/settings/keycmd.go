// keyCommandTimeout bounds one api_key_command. A key command that stops to ask
// a question, wait on a lock or reach an unreachable network would otherwise
// hang the run before its first turn, where the failure reads as kori being
// slow rather than as a command nobody answered.

// ResolveKeys fills each api key a command is responsible for.
//
// An api_key_command exists so that a config file can carry no secret: the file
// names how to obtain the key and the process that owns it decides whether to
// hand one over. That makes it a source rather than an override — a key any
// layer already supplied wins, whether that layer is a flag, the environment, a
// file or a profile, and a command runs only to fill what is still empty. So a
// TYPESAFE_API_KEY already exported on a machine keeps working untouched and the
// command is never run to disagree with it, and the command runs only on the
// paths that actually speak to a provider: a read-only invocation like
// `kori list` never runs it, so a locked secret store cannot break inspection.
//
// A command that fails, times out or prints nothing is a load error naming the
// field, never an empty key. An empty key reaches the backend as "no credential"
// and reads exactly like a config that simply forgot one, which is the failure
// this whole setting exists to avoid.

// KeyFromCommand runs one key command through the shell and returns the key it
// printed, or an empty string when there is no command to run.
//
// The command goes through `sh -c`, the same way a hook's does, because the
// point of the setting is to name a program with its arguments; the config file
// holding it is already trusted to spawn MCP servers, gates and hooks. Its stdin
// is left closed rather than inherited, so a command that prompts for a
// passphrase fails against end-of-file instead of seizing the terminal or
// waiting forever behind a timeout.
//
// Only stdout becomes the key, and only its first line: trimming is forgiving
// about the trailing newline every `get` prints. stderr is read for the error
// message and never for the key, so a command that warns on stderr still works
// while a key is never taken from a stream a warning could share.
